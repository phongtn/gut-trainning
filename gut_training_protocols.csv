Protocol Type,Duration,Primary Adaptation,Performance Benefit,Evidence Quality
High-carbohydrate diet (8.5 g/kg/day),28 days,Increased SGLT1 transporters,16% increase in glucose oxidation,Strong (RCT)
Carbohydrate gel intake during exercise,2 weeks,Reduced GI symptoms,5% improvement in exercise performance,Strong (RCT)
Glucose supplementation (400g/day),3-4 days,Faster gastric emptying of glucose,Improved carbohydrate tolerance,Moderate (controlled study)
Fructose supplementation (120g/day),3 days,Faster gastric emptying of fructose,Nutrient-specific adaptation,Moderate (controlled study)
High-fat diet (258g/day),14 days,Faster gastric emptying of fats,Fat-specific adaptation,Moderate (controlled study)
Multiple carbohydrate sources (glucose:fructose 2:1),Ongoing,Enhanced absorption capacity,Up to 75% higher oxidation rates,Strong (multiple studies)
Progressive volume training,2-4 weeks,Increased stomach tolerance,Reduced bloating and discomfort,Moderate (observational)
Regular fueling practice during training,6-12 weeks,Improved gut comfort,Reduced GI distress,Strong (multiple studies)
